Welcome! I'm Allie, a cognitive neuroscientist & psychologist studying **memory and behavior change.** I develop interventions that help us learn from error, update beliefs, and make choices that are better for our health and planet.

I am currently the Joan Bossert Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the **University of Pennsylvania**, primarily working with Prof. Emily Falk and others in the <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/centers/communication-neuroscience-lab">Communication Neuroscience Lab</a>. I am also a member of the <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/pcssm/">Center for Science, Sustainability, & the Media</a> and the <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/">Annenberg School for Communication</a>.

I completed my Ph.D. in Psychology & Neuroscience at **Duke University**, where I was co-advised by <a href="https://www.adcocklab.org/">Prof. Alison Adcock</a> and <a href="https://www.mcablab.science/">Prof. Gregory Samanez-Larkin</a>. Prior to my Ph.D., I earned an Honours B.Sc. in Psychology from the **University of Toronto**.



Research Overview
======
How can we motivate **behavior change** to address climate change and promote health? How can we correct **misinformation** and increase the **spread and impact** of high-quality information? How can educators help students **learn** from their mistakes?

These real-world challenges are linked by common mechanismsâ€” I study how our time-traveling brains **recall the past** and **predict the future** to update beliefs and guide behavior. I also explore how **emotion and motivation** shape how we learn and make decisions.

My research combines behavioral experiments, brain imaging (fMRI), and large-scale online field studies. I curate a metaphorical *intervention toolbox* filled with flexible, generalizable strategies that can enhance **learning, belief updating,** and **behavior change** across domains.
