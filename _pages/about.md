My name is Allie, and I'm a PhD Candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience at Duke University, where I'm co-supervised by <a href="https://www.adcocklab.org/">Dr. Alison Adcock</a> and <a href="https://www.mcablab.science/">Dr. Gregory Samanez-Larkin</a>. Before I came to Duke, I earned an Honours B.Sc. in Psychology (Research Specialization) from the University of Toronto, where I graduated as the top student of my year. There, I worked with <a href="https://barense.psych.utoronto.ca/">Dr. Morgan Barense</a> and <a href="https://socialcognitivescience.ca/">Dr. William Cunningham</a> to research how prediction error influences episodic memories and social learning. 



Research Overview
======
What can we do to help people learn from error? I'm interested in **how** and **why** we update our memories and beliefs in response to feedback. Our flexible brains can recreate and revise our memories, letting us correct mistakes and integrate old and new knowledge. Yet we don't always learn from feedback! My research explores the cognitive and neural conditions that make memory updating possible. 


Applications
======
Understanding (and encouraging) learning from error lets us address many real-world problems. In ongoing work, I am testing applications for **improving education**, **correcting misinformation**, and **changing beliefs about risk**.
