Welcome! I'm Allie, a cognitive neuroscientist & psychologist studying how people _update_ their **memories, beliefs,** and **behaviors**. I develop interventions that help address challenges in **education, health,** and **climate change**. 

**UPDATE:** In 2026, I will be starting as an Assistant Professor at **Rice University** in the [Department of Psychological Sciences](https://psychology.rice.edu/). Please reach out if you are interested in joining my lab! 

I am currently the Joan Bossert Postdoctoral Fellow at the **University of Pennsylvania**, working with Emily Falk in the <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/centers/communication-neuroscience-lab">Communication Neuroscience Lab</a>. I am also a member of the <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/pcssm/">Center for Science, Sustainability, & the Media</a> and the <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/">Annenberg School for Communication</a>.

I previously completed a Ph.D. at **Duke University** (co-advised by <a href="https://www.adcocklab.org/">Alison Adcock</a> and <a href="https://www.mcablab.science/">Gregory Samanez-Larkin</a>) and a B.Sc. at the **University of Toronto**.



Research Overview
======
- How can we motivate **behavior change** to address climate change and improve health?
- How can we correct **misconceptions** and counteract **misinformation**?
- How can educators help students **learn** from their mistakes?

These real-world challenges are linked by common mechanismsâ€” I study how our time-traveling brains **recall the past** and **predict the future** to update beliefs and guide adaptive behavior. I also explore how **emotion and motivation** shape how we learn and make decisions.

My research combines behavioral experiments, brain imaging (fMRI), and large-scale online field studies. I curate a metaphorical *intervention toolbox* of generalizable strategies that can enhance **learning, belief updating,** and **behavior change** across domains.
