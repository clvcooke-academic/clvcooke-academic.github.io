Welcome! I'm Allie, a cognitive neuroscientist & psychologist studying how people update their **memories, beliefs,** and **behaviors**. I develop interventions that help address real-world challenges in **education, health,** and **climate change**. 

**UPDATE:** In 2026, I will be starting as an Assistant Professor at **Rice University** in the Department of Psychological Sciences. Please **[check out my new lab website](https://www.sinclairlab-rice.com/)** and reach out if you are interested in joining my lab! 

I am currently the Joan Bossert Postdoctoral Fellow at the **University of Pennsylvania**, working with Emily Falk in the <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/centers/communication-neuroscience-lab">Communication Neuroscience Lab</a>. I am also a member of the <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/pcssm/">Center for Science, Sustainability, & the Media</a> and the <a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/">Annenberg Public Policy Center</a>.

I previously completed a Ph.D. at **Duke University** (co-advised by <a href="https://www.adcocklab.org/">Alison Adcock</a> and <a href="https://www.mcablab.science/">Gregory Samanez-Larkin</a>) and a B.Sc. at the **University of Toronto** (honours thesis advised by [Morgan Barense](https://barense.psych.utoronto.ca/)).



Research Overview
======
- How can educators help students **learn** from their mistakes?
- How can we motivate **behavior change** to improve health and address climate change?
- How can we correct and counteract **misinformation**?

These real-world challenges are linked by common mechanismsâ€” I study how our time-traveling brains **recall the past** and **predict the future** to guide adaptive behavior. I also explore how **emotion and motivation** shape the information we choose to consume and the details we remember. 

My research combines behavioral experiments, brain imaging (fMRI), and large-scale online field studies. I curate a metaphorical *intervention toolbox* of generalizable strategies that can enhance **learning, belief updating,** and **behavior change** across domains.
