Welcome! I'm Allie, a psychologist studying **motivation, behavior change, and memory**. I develop behavioral interventions that help us learn from error, update beliefs, and make choices that are better for our health and planet.

I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at the **University of Pennsylvania**, where I am supported by the Joan Bossert Postdoctoral Fellowship in the <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/pcssm/">Center for Science, Sustainability, & the Media.</a> I primarily collaborate with Prof. Emily Falk and others in the <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/centers/communication-neuroscience-lab">Communication Neuroscience Lab.</a>

I completed my Ph.D. in Psychology & Neuroscience at **Duke University**, where I was co-advised by <a href="https://www.adcocklab.org/">Prof. Alison Adcock</a> and <a href="https://www.mcablab.science/">Prof. Gregory Samanez-Larkin</a>. Prior to my Ph.D., I earned an Honours BSc in Psychology (Research Specialization) from the **University of Toronto**. There, I worked with <a href="https://barense.psych.utoronto.ca/">Prof. Morgan Barense</a> and <a href="https://socialcognitivescience.ca/">Prof. William Cunningham</a> to investigate how prediction error influences episodic memories and social learning. 



Research Overview
======
How can we increase **prosocial behavior** to address climate change and public health issues? How can we correct **misinformation** and increase the **spread and impact** of high-quality information? How can educators help students **learn** from their mistakes?

These diverse real-world challenges are unified by common psychological and neural mechanisms. I study the fundamental processes of **motivation, learning, and memory** to inspire interventions. I translate findings from controlled experiments in the lab to impactful real-world settings. 

I study how emotion, motivation, and social identity **shape *how* and *what* we learn**. My research program combines behavioral experiments, brain neuroimaging (fMRI), and large-scale online field studies. I curate a metaphorical *intervention toolbox* filled with flexible, generalizable strategies that can be used to enhance **learning, belief updating, and prosocial behavior** across domains.
