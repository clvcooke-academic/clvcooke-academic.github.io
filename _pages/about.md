My name is Allie, and I'm a PhD Candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience at Duke University, where I'm co-supervised by <a href="https://www.adcocklab.org/">Dr. Alison Adcock</a> and <a href="https://www.mcablab.science/">Dr. Gregory Samanez-Larkin</a>. In 2018, I graduated from the University of Toronto as the top student of my year, earning an Honours B.Sc. in Psychology (Research Specialization). At UofT, I worked with <a href="https://barense.psych.utoronto.ca/">Dr. Morgan Barense</a> and <a href="https://socialcognitivescience.ca/">Dr. William Cunningham</a> to research how prediction error influences episodic memories and social learning. 



Research Interests
======
I'm interested in how expectation and surprise influence learning. Surprising new information can modify memories, bearing implications for education, eyewitness testimony, belief and updating. Memory malleability is a two-sided coin: Our flexible brains recreate experiences, which can produce false memories but can also help us update our knowledge with relevant new information. My long-term goals include applying this research to improve education and science communication, combat the spread of misinformation, and understand belief updating. To explore these research questions, I conduct both behavioral and fMRI studies.



Key Projects
======
1.    Investigating how surprising reminders let episodic memories be updated
2.    Changing beliefs and intentions about risky behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic
3.    Exploring how the motivational and affective context of learning shapes responses to prediction error
4.    Modeling the relationship between episodic memory and model-based reinforcement learning
