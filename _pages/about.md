I'm a PhD Candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience at Duke University, where I'm co-supervised by <a href="https://www.adcocklab.org/">Alison Adcock</a> and <a href="https://www.mcablab.science/">Gregory Samanez-Larkin </a>. I graduated from the University of Toronto with a Research Specialist B.Sc. in Psychology. At UofT, I worked with Morgan Barense and William Cunningham to research how prediction error influences episodic memories and social learning. 

Research Interests
======
I'm interested in how expectation and surprise can influence and alter memories. Surprising reminders can distort memories, bearing implications for eyewitness testimony and the spread of misinformation. However, the same processes can be helpful; learning from error allows us to correct our mistakes and integrate old and new knowledge. My long-term goals include extending this line of research to improve education and combat real-world false memories.

Ongoing Projects
======
1.    Investigating how surprising and incomplete reminders distort naturalistic episodic memories, through behavioral and fMRI studies
2.    Modeling the interactions between episodic memory and model-based decision making across the lifespan
3.    Exploring individual differences in belief updating and learning from error
