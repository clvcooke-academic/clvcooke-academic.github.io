My name is Allie, and I'm a PhD Candidate (ABD) in Cognitive Neuroscience at Duke University, where I'm co-supervised by <a href="https://www.adcocklab.org/">Dr. Alison Adcock</a> and <a href="https://www.mcablab.science/">Dr. Gregory Samanez-Larkin</a>. Before I came to Duke, I earned an Honours B.Sc. in Psychology (Research Specialization) from the University of Toronto. There, I worked with <a href="https://barense.psych.utoronto.ca/">Dr. Morgan Barense</a> and <a href="https://socialcognitivescience.ca/">Dr. William Cunningham</a> to research how prediction error influences episodic memories and social learning. 



Research Overview
======
How can **educators** help students learn from their mistakes? How can **public health interventions** change beliefs, attitudes, and risky behaviors? How can we combat **misinformation** by correcting false beliefs and motivating information seeking? How do we motivate individuals to take action against **climate change**?

These diverse real-world challenges are unified by common cognitive and neural mechanisms. My research on **learning, memory, and motivation** reveals these underlying mechanisms to inspire interventions. I work toward developing a metaphorical **intervention toolbox** filled with flexible, generalizable strategies that can be used to improve **learning, behavior change, and communication** across domains.
