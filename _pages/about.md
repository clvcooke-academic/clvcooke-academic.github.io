My name is Allie, and I'm a **cognitive neuroscientist**. I develop interventions that help us learn from error, update beliefs, and make choices that are better for our health, planet, and democracy. My research applies cognitive and neural mechanisms to **education, health, climate change**, and more. 

I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at the **University of Pennsylvania**, where I am supported by the Joan Bossert Postdoctoral Fellowship in the <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/pcssm/">Center for Science, Sustainability, & the Media.</a> I primarily collaborate with Prof. Emily Falk and others in the <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/centers/communication-neuroscience-lab">Communication Neuroscience Lab.</a>

I recently completed my PhD in Psychology & Neuroscience at **Duke University**, where I was co-supervised by <a href="https://www.adcocklab.org/">Prof. Alison Adcock</a> and <a href="https://www.mcablab.science/">Prof. Gregory Samanez-Larkin</a>. Before I came to Duke, I earned an Honours BSc in Psychology (Research Specialization) from the **University of Toronto**. There, I worked with <a href="https://barense.psych.utoronto.ca/">Prof. Morgan Barense</a> and <a href="https://socialcognitivescience.ca/">Prof. William Cunningham</a> to investigate how prediction error influences episodic memories and social learning. 



Research Overview
======
How can **educators** help students learn from their mistakes? How can **public health interventions** change beliefs, attitudes, and risky behaviors? How do we motivate individuals to take action against **climate change**?

These diverse real-world challenges are unified by common cognitive and neural mechanisms. My research on **learning, memory, and motivation** reveals these underlying mechanisms to inspire interventions. I curate a metaphorical **intervention toolbox** filled with flexible, generalizable strategies that can be used to improve **learning, behavior change, and communication** across domains. To this end, I use a combination of functional neuroimaging, controlled behavioral experiments, and large-scale field studies.
