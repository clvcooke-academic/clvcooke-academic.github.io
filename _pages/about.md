Welcome! I'm Allie, a psychologist studying **motivation, memory, and behavior change**. I develop behavioral interventions that help us learn from error, update beliefs, and make choices that are better for our health and planet.

I am currently the Joan Bossert Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the **University of Pennsylvania**, primarily working with Prof. Emily Falk and others in the <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/centers/communication-neuroscience-lab">Communication Neuroscience Lab</a>. I am also a member of the <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/">Annenberg School for Communication</a> and the <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/pcssm/">Center for Science, Sustainability, & the Media</a>.

I completed my Ph.D. in Psychology & Neuroscience at **Duke University**, where I was co-advised by <a href="https://www.adcocklab.org/">Prof. Alison Adcock</a> and <a href="https://www.mcablab.science/">Prof. Gregory Samanez-Larkin</a>. Prior to my Ph.D., I earned an Honours BSc in Psychology (Research Specialization) from the **University of Toronto**. There, I worked with <a href="https://barense.psych.utoronto.ca/">Prof. Morgan Barense</a> and <a href="https://socialcognitivescience.ca/">Prof. William Cunningham</a> to investigate how prediction error influences episodic memories and social learning. 



Research Overview
======
How can we increase **prosocial behavior** to address climate change and public health issues? How can we correct **misinformation** and increase the **spread and impact** of high-quality information? How can educators help students **learn** from their mistakes?

These diverse real-world challenges are unified by common psychological and neural mechanisms. I study how **emotion, motivation, and social identity** shape our memories, beliefs, and actions. I translate findings from controlled experiments in the lab to real-world settings. 

My research program combines behavioral experiments, brain imaging (fMRI), and large-scale online field studies. I curate a metaphorical *intervention toolbox* filled with flexible, generalizable strategies that can be used to enhance **learning, belief updating, and prosocial behavior** across domains.
